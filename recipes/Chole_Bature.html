        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>For Preparing Chole</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Wash and soak dried chickpeas in plenty of water overnight. In the morning, drain and rinse them.</li>
        <li> In a large pot, add the soaked chickpeas, enough water to cover them, a tea bag (for color), and a pinch of baking soda. Boil until the chickpeas are tender. This may take about 20-30 minutes. Drain and discard the tea bag.</li>
        <li> Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown. Add minced garlic and green chilies and sauté for a minute. Add tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the masala.</li>
        <li> Add turmeric, coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook the masala until it's well roasted and aromatic.</li>
        <li> Add the cooked chickpeas to the masala and mix well. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. If needed, add water to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
        <li> Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For Bature</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, yogurt, baking powder, baking soda, salt, sugar, and vegetable oil. Mix well. Add water gradually to make a soft, pliable dough. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> Cover the dough and let it rest for 2-3 hours at room temperature.</li>
        <li> Divide the dough into small balls and roll them into thin discs. Heat oil in a deep frying pan. Fry the rolled dough one at a time until they puff up and turn golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.</li>
    </ol>
