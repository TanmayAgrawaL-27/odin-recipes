    <img src="../recipes/images/Pav Bhaji.jpg" alt="Delectable Pav Bhaji - A savory Indian dish with buns and Bhaji" width="500" height="500">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>At its core, pav bhaji is a simple blend of staples like tomatoes, potatoes, onions, peas, capsicum, and cauliflower with a pre-made masala. However, the results, especially when served with a generous dollop of butter, sprinkle of lime juice, and a side of bread rolls is anything but simple. This comfort dish can stand in for a complete meal or satiate mid-day snack cravings. It's no wonder that the soupy, spicy mash has made it to the favourites lists of many avid foodies.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Start with making the pav bhaji masala. To do this, set a pan on medium low and heat until moderately hot. Then lower the heat and add coriander seeds and jeera seeds, roasting them on a low flame for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add the remaining whole spices and roast on a low flame until fragrant. Then add kasuri methi and briefly roast for a few seconds.</li>
        <li> Transfer the roasted spices to a plate and allow them to cool down to room temperature. Then transfer the mixture to a grinding jar, add the powdered spices, and grind to form a fine powder.</li>
        <li> Store this mixture in an airtight container and set it aside in the fridge until needed</li>
        <li> For the red chilli paste, transfer the soaked Kashmiri red chillies to a mixer grinder, add water as required and grind to form a fine, runny paste.</li>
        <li> For the garlic paste, transfer garlic cloves to a mixer grinder, add water as required, and grind to form a fine, runny paste with a watery consistency.</li>
        <li> To boil the vegetables just right, set the water to boil in a stock pot, add the vegetables, turmeric powder and salt. Cover with a lid and boil until the vegetables turn soft and are cooked through. Strain the water and put them aside for later.</li>
        <li> Set a big size pan on medium high heat and add butter and oil. Then add jeera and allow the seeds to crackle.</li>
        <li> Now add onions and cook until they turn pale pink. Add capsicums, turn the heat up to high, and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
